We need to update `kramdown(1.17)` because of a critical vunerability; 

`$ bundle audit --update`

```
Name: kramdown
Version: 1.17.0
Advisory: CVE-2020-14001
Criticality: Critical
URL: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mqm2-cgpr-p4m6
Title: Unintended read access in kramdown gem
Solution: upgrade to >= 2.3.0

Vulnerabilities found!
```

However, upgrading `kramdown` is not as simple as editing the `Gemfile` and running `bundle install` or `gem update` simply because `kramdown(1.14)` is a dependency of `jekyll(3.8.7)`;

```
jekyll (3.8.7)
 47       addressable (~> 2.4)
 48       colorator (~> 1.0)
 49       em-websocket (~> 0.5)
 50       i18n (~> 0.7)
 51       jekyll-sass-converter (~> 1.0)
 52       jekyll-watch (~> 2.0)
 53       kramdown (~> 1.14)
 54       liquid (~> 4.0)
 55       mercenary (~> 0.3.3)
 56       pathutil (~> 0.9)
 57       rouge (>= 1.7, < 4)
 58       safe_yaml (~> 1.0)

```
and is thus fixed. Btw, all version of `kramdown < 2.3.0` are vulnerable to `CVE-2020-14001.`

So to fix that, we could try running;
`bundle update --patch --conservative kramdown`

But `bundle` reports back with;
`Bundler attempted to update kramdown but its version stayed the same`

So upgrading to `Jekyll 3.9.0+` is our next option since that comes with `kramdown v2.0+`;

```
$ vi Gemfile
 11 # Happy Jekylling!
 12 gem "jekyll", "~> 4.0"
 13 
```
Now when we run `bundle update jekyll` `jekyll(3.8.7)` and it's dependencies including `kramdown` are updated.

```
jekyll (4.1.1)
 47       addressable (~> 2.4)
 48       colorator (~> 1.0)
 49       em-websocket (~> 0.5)
 50       i18n (~> 1.0)
 51       jekyll-sass-converter (~> 2.0)
 52       jekyll-watch (~> 2.0)
 53       kramdown (~> 2.1)
 54       kramdown-parser-gfm (~> 1.0)
 55       liquid (~> 4.0)
 56       mercenary (~> 0.4.0)
 57       pathutil (~> 0.9)
 58       rouge (~> 3.0)
 59       safe_yaml (~> 1.0)
 60       terminal-table (~> 1.8)
```

## CVE-2020-14001?

According to the national vulnerability database ([NVD][1]), [CVE-2020-14001][2] is a critical vulnerability 
> which allows unintended read access (such as template=`/etc/passwd`) or unintended embedded Ruby code execution (such as a string that begins with template="string://<%=`).

<br>
## HTML & CSS  in kramdown

You can apply a `CSS` class anywhere in your karmdown file using the `{: .className}` option which makes it easier to style different parts of your `karmdown.` 
karmdown also allows `HTML` mixing;
```
{::options parse_span_html ="true" /}
```
>...the kramdown parser processes the content of span HTML tags as text containing span-level elements.

<br>

## The Problem With The {::options /} Extension

Setting `{::options template="/etc/passwd"}` allows unintended read access to `/etc/passwd` which can help an attacker guess user passwords or gain access to other crucial files in `/etc` such as `/etc/shadow`. 

To mitigate the vulnerability, a `forbidden_inline_options` option was added in `karmdown 2.3.0`. 

This allows developers 
> to restrict options allowed with the `{::options /}` extensions.
