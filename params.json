Can't say anything else beyond that except that I'm also using bootstrap and fontawesome. I'm also working on another flaskr app , mulyrica which actually will use nlp packages (written in python) and javascript/jquery. I'm developing my own API to use with the app.\r\n### \r\n### About me.\r\nNothing to say here.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nWrite to me 0xc06cd103938bf72a",
