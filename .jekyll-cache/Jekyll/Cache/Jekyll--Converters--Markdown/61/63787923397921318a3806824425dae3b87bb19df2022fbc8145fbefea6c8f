I"è<p>Welcome to my blog.</p>

<p>I created this blog using the carte noire dark theme for Jekyll by Jacob Tomlinson.
Installing the theme wasnâ€™t hard but integrating my bootstrap resume was time consuming mostly because I havenâ€™t played around with Jekyl in a while.</p>

<p>Initially, I had planed on hosting my resume on a seperate domain but that turned out not to be appealing to me. I wanted to have all my stuff in one place
so I decided to include it somewhere on the blog. I had toyed with idea of blending it into the dark theme but decided against it. The two themes
balance each other well.  So all I had to do, I thought, was just add a link to the blogâ€™s hambuger menu. It turned out to be a little more than that.</p>

<p>To use the resumeâ€™s assets I had to create a second â€˜head.htmlâ€™ for the resume. I named it â€œres-header.htmlâ€. I renamed the resumeâ€™s â€œindex.htmlâ€ to â€œresume.htmlâ€ and transferred 
all header content to â€œres-head.htmlâ€. Likewise for â€œres-footer.htmlâ€. I then added a link to the resume in â€œ_includes/header.htmlâ€ and created a â€œ_layout/resume.htmlâ€  layout for the resume. â€œ./resume.htmlâ€ would be the content to this layout. I updated all the links in the resumeâ€™s header, footer files as well as the resumeâ€™s main file â€œ./resume.htmlâ€ and merged all the resumeâ€™s assets with my blogsâ€™.</p>

<p>The rest was just customizing â€œ_includes/social_links.htmlâ€ and editing the resume and adding a few things/sections.</p>
